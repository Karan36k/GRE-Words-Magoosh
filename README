Note-1: I don't own the content. It has been scraped from Magoosh Flashcards (https://gre.magoosh.com/flashcards/vocabulary/decks).

Note-2: Don't care to look at the source code. It's dirty. It reeks. And if you decide to go ahead despite these warnings, note that all known dimensions will collapse into nothingness.

Contains the following things:
 > Words.txt - A list of 1000 words from Magoosh.
 > main.py - The python script. Refer to usage examples below.
 > process.dict - JSON file mapping the words to the HTML explanation.
 > out.html (generated) - The HTML output.


This tiny utility does/has the following things:
 - Has a list of 1000 words from Magoosh (Words.txt).
 - Has a way to retrieve the description/explanation by making 1000 requests to Magoosh. This is long running (single threaded) process Good part: It can resume from where it left off. :)
 - Generates an ugly HTML such that one can see all the words in one (big) screen.
 - Provides the ability to append the words with a "*" in the file: "Words.txt" manually, so that the generated HTML highlights that word for review purposes.
 - Even better, runs a full HTTP server that takes care of editing the Words.txt file, and reloading the WebView w/ appropriate changes to the highlight. There is a link called "MARK" within word descriptions for this.

Usage Examples:

*** Offline, Non-server mode ***

Step 1:
Update the Words.txt file manually. Append each word that you dont know with a "*". Eg line below:

word1 word2 word3 word4* word5

.. where word4 is a word you'd want to highlight.

Step 2:
run the below command:

$ python main.py

Step 3:
Open out.html locally.


*** Online, server mode ***

Step 1:
Run below command:
$ python main.py -serve 9001

Step 2:
Open any browser other than IE (die IE!) and point to "http://localhost:9001/".

Step 3:
For every word that you dont know, click on the word, and then click on "MARK".
